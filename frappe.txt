What i understand till now is that frappe combines all things, such as frontend bakcend database and apis as well
Frappe itself is full stack
It lets the developer write less code and handles all the functionalities itself 
What is different here? they define the metadata and like DB, UI rather than coding the logic
Its the foundation for ERPnext (Enterprise resource planning)
