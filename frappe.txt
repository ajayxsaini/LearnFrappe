What i understand till now is that frappe combines all things, such as frontend bakcend database and apis as well
Frappe itself is full stack
It lets the developer write less code and handles all the functionalities itself 
What is different here? they define the metadata and like DB, UI rather than coding the logic
Its the foundation for ERPnext (Enterprise resource planning)

This is how it works in normal project
frontend(react) --> api (express/django) --> Backend Logic  ---> Database (sql)
each and everything which is separated by arrows are written separately 

This is now it works in frappe 
        DocType (Metadata)
              ↓
 ┌────────────┼────────────┐
 ↓            ↓            ↓
Database   Backend API    UI

Doctype is a blueprint 
┌───────────────┐
│   DocType     │
│   Student     │
└───────┬───────┘
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────────────────┐
│ SQL Table: tabStudent     │
└───────────────────────────┘

┌───────────────────────────┐
│ Python Class: Student()   │
└───────────────────────────┘

┌───────────────────────────┐
│ REST API                  │
│ /api/resource/Student     │
└───────────────────────────┘

┌───────────────────────────┐
│ UI Form + List View       │
└───────────────────────────┘

┌───────────────────────────┐
│ Permissions + Roles       │
└───────────────────────────┘

This one DocType creates all of these, a sql table, python class, an api in the correct folder etc




ERPNext is a ready-made business system built on top of Frappe.

Now here is what is important, different users would see different modules based on permissions they have
So say, if these are some of the users --> Accountant, HR, Sales
If an accountant logs, then he will be able to see the UI and modules related to his work (bacause he only has access to 
those). On top of that, frappe will take care of what to be shown and what not to be shown for us using the permissions.


ERPNext
 ├─ Selling
 ├─ Buying
 ├─ Stock
 ├─ Accounts
 ├─ HR
 ├─ Manufacturing
 └─ CRM

Each module is the collection of the DocType (blueprint), so, for something like Selling 
Selling
 ├─ Customer
 ├─ Item
 ├─ Quotation
 ├─ Sales Order
 ├─ Delivery Note
 └─ Sales Invoice


ERPNext itself does not run on AI, it uses AI to reduce human effort, not replace logic.
